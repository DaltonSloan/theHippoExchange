  * **Git**: You'll need Git installed to clone the repository.

### Local Development

This project is set up to run in a containerized environment for easy development.

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```

2.  **Open in VS Code**:

    MONGO_DB_NAME=
    MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE=
    ```

5.  **Run the application**: Once the container is up and running, open the integrated terminal in VS Code and run the following commands:
